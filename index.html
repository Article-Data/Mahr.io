<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u>Synopsis:</u> This is a beautiful story about Mahr. <br>
Mahr is the obligation in the form of money or possessions paid by the Groom to the Bride at the time of Islamic Marriage. </b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px"> Hiba Ammar writes, <br>
When my father proposed to my mother, he dedicated Surah Al-Imran, which he memorized off heart, as her "Mahr".
And when my husband proposed to me, my father told him that he would have to memorize a Surah of Al-Qur'an as my mahr. The wedding will not go on unless 
i have received my mahr, I was asked to pick one of the Surahs.
I chose Surah Al-Noor. For all the lawsthat Surah contained within it and for the fact that it seemed hard to memorize on my behalf. </p> <br>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px; text-align:center;"> <b>And before our wedding day, Aside of being busy preparing for our "Newly Wedded Nest",<br> The Qur'an wouldn't leave my
husband's hand an entire month as he was memorizing the Surah </b> </p>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px"> A few days before our wedding day, my husband came to recite to my father the Surah which he had completed. My father
told him every time you make a mistake, you have to start from the beginning all over again. My husband began reciting Surah Al-Noor with his calm/gentle voice
in such a "beautiful scene" which i will never forget. My mother and i would look at one another and would smile awaiting my husband to make a mistake so he would
have to start all over again and by that increase my "Reward". But my husband - May Allah bless him - had memorized the Surah off heart and didn't even forget
one single verse of it. Once he finished, my father hugged him and said to him,<br><br><b> "Today I shall marry my daughter to you, for you have fulfilled her
MAHR and your pledge to me..." </b><br><br>
He didn't pay me a financial mahr and we didn't buy gold worth Tens of thousands. He sufficed me with Allah's words as an oath/contract between us.<br>
And the Questions is, <b>I wonder what Surah my daughter will choose as her MAHR in future?</b> </p> <br><br><br>
